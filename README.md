# PyBer_Analysis
Using python, Pandas, and Matplotlib

## Overview 
This analysis was done for a ride-share company (PyBer), with the pressure on from an executive to prepare a presentation on a large amount of PyBer data. The analysis dives into the city types (rural, urban, suburban), and then looks further into the statistics of drivers and riders. This analysis shows the financial statistics that result from drivers and riders in each city type, which could give the PyBer company a better understanding of how to grow the business strategically, and if there are any current areas that need improvement when comparing the three city types.  

## Results
The summary of PyBer data when specifically focusing on city type, drivers, riders, and fares can be seen in the image below.

This image shows a lot of important statistics:
- The urban city type has a lot of use/traffic through the app. It brings in a revenue that nearly doubles the other two types combined.  However, the average ride is slightly cheaper, and there seems to be an influx of drivers which could potentially oversaturate the market.  They seem to making good money though in urban areas, and there will always be a need for the service in the urban areas due to less people relying on their own vehicles for day-to-day travel.
- The suburban city type has less drivers than riders (490 < 625), so they have great margins at $30.97 for average fare per ride and $39.50 for average fare per driver.  The only potential downside that this data shows for suburban cities is that there seems to be a bit of competition amongst the drivers, so even if the fares are higher, they will be getting less business.  
- The rural type shows high fare prices, but there are not many users in this demographic.  Even though the total fare revenue is low, there is potential in this area since ride prices can be higher.  Rides are likely to be further due to less businesses/housing that is close together in rural communities.  If this can be balanced out with a good ratio of supply/demand (riders/drivers), then they still have a lot of potential to make money in many rural communities.
